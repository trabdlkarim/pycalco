Welcome to PyCalco Docs
=======================


This is the top level of the PyCalco’s technical documentation tree. This documentation, like the project itself, is very much a work in progress; that is especially true as we work to integrate our many scattered documents into a coherent whole. Please note that improvements to the documentation are welcome; send us a feedback if you want to help out.

Getting Started with PyCalco
============================

These manuals contain overall information about how PyCalco works. The PyCalco community might be quite large, with thousands of developers contributing over the course of a year. As with any large community, knowing how things are done will make the process of getting your changes merged much easier.

Other Useful Pages
==================

This is a section for several resources and unsorted documents that don’t seem to fit on other parts of the documentation body, or may require some adjustments and/or conversion to ReStructured Text format, or are simply too old.
