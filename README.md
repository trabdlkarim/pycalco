PyCalco or shortly Calco is a powerful command line interface for arithmetics and algebraic or symbolic expressions evaluation. Its power relies on the **math** module from Python standard library and **SymPy** module, which is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. If you are new to SymPy or symbolic computation, start with their [tutorial](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/tutorial/index.html#tutorial), it is a great place where to start from.
