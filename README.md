PyCalco or shortly Calco is a powerful command line interface for arithmetic and algebraic or symbolic expressions evaluation. Its power relies on the **math** module from Python standard library and **SymPy** module, which is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. If you are new to SymPy or symbolic computation, start with their [tutorial](https://docs.sympy.org/latest/tutorial/index.html#tutorial), it is a great place where to start from.

# Why Another Python Calculator?

# Installation

PyCalco is available on the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org/project/pycalco/), which makes its intallation quite easy.
You just need python3 and its package manager pip3 on your plateform, then you are set to install PyCalco.

Run the following command from the terminal for installion:

`pip install pycalco`

If that didn't work, try:

`python3 -m pip install pycalco`

# Usage

After installation to run PyCalco interactively just type, again from the terminal, the following command:

`pycalco`

And voil√†, you are ready to use PyCalco. You see the PyCalco shell waiting for you to enter your commands and evaluate expressions.
